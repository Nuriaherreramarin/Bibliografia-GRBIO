   abstract = {<p>Drug tolerant persister (DTP) cells enter into a reversible slow-cycling state after drug treatment. We performed proteomic characterization of the breast cancer (BC) DTP cell secretome after eribulin treatment. We showed that the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a protein significantly over-secreted upon eribulin treatment. The biomarker potential of GDF15 was confirmed in 3D-cell culture models using BC cells lines and PDXs, as well as in a TNBC in vivo model. We also found that GDF15 is required for survival of DTP cells. Direct participation of GDF15 and its receptor GFRAL in eribulin-induction of DTPs was established by the enhanced cell killing of DTPs by eribulin seen under GDF15 and GFRAL loss of function assays. Finally, we showed that combination therapy of eribulin plus an anti-GDF15 antibody kills BC-DTP cells. Our results suggest that targeting GDF15 may help eradicate DTP cells and block the onset of acquired resistance.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Relative control of HIV-1 infection has been linked to genetic and immune host factors. In this study, we analyzed 96 plasma proteome arrays from chronic untreated HIV-1–infected individuals using the classificatory random forest approach to discriminate between uncontrolled disease (plasma viral load [pVL] &amp;gt;50,000 RNA copies/ml; CD4 counts 283 cells/mm3, n = 47) and relatively controlled disease (pVL &amp;lt;10,000 RNA copies/ml; CD4 counts 657 cells/mm3, n = 49). Our analysis highlighted the TNF molecule’s relevance, in particular, TL1A (TNFSF15) and its cognate DR3 (TNFSRF25), both of which increased in the relative virus control phenotype. DR3 levels (in plasma and PBMCs) were validated in unrelated cohorts (including long-term nonprogressors), thus confirming their independence from CD4 counts and pVL. Further analysis in combined antiretroviral treatment (cART)–treated individuals with a wide range of CD4 counts (137–1835 cells/mm3) indicated that neither TL1A nor DR3 levels reflected recovery of CD4 counts with cART. Interestingly, in cART-treated individuals, plasma TL1A levels correlated with regulatory T cell frequencies, whereas soluble DR3 was strongly associated with the abundance of effector HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells. A positive correlation was also observed between plasma DR3 levels and the HIV-1–specific T cell responses. In vitro, costimulation of PBMC with DR3-specific mAb increased the magnitude of HIV-1–specific responses. Finally, in splenocytes of DNA.HTI-vaccinated mice, costimulation of HTI peptides and a DR3 agonist (4C12) intensified the magnitude of T cell responses by 27%. These data describe the role of the TL1A–DR3 axis in the natural control of HIV-1 infection and point to the use of DR3 agonists in HIV-1 vaccine regimens.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Though variable selection is one of the most relevant tasks in microbiome analysis, e.g. for the identification of microbial signatures, many studies still rely on methods that ignore the compositional nature of microbiome data. The applicability of compositional data analysis methods has been hampered by the availability of software and the difficulty in interpreting their results. This work is focused on three methods for variable selection that acknowledge the compositional structure of microbiome data: selbal, a forward selection approach for the identification of compositional balances, and clr-lasso and coda-lasso, two penalized regression models for compositional data analysis. This study highlights the link between these methods and brings out some limitations of the centered log-ratio transformation for variable selection. In particular, the fact that it is not subcompositionally consistent makes the microbial signatures obtained from clr-lasso not readily transferable. Coda-lasso is computationally efficient and suitable when the focus is the identification of the most associated microbial taxa. Selbal stands out when the goal is to obtain a parsimonious model with optimal prediction performance, but it is computationally greedy. We provide a reproducible vignette for the application of these methods that will enable researchers to fully leverage their potential in microbiome studies.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>This study sought to determine whether the inclusion of an opponent on an isoinertial crossover step task influenced the post-activation response and power production. Twenty adult male team-sports athletes participated in a randomized crossover trial. We used a novel design in which the performance of an isoinertial flywheel exercise was tested with or without the inclusion of sport-specific constraints (inclusion of an opponent vs. no opponent) in one of the two sequences (sequence one: constraint manipulation followed by no constraint manipulation; and sequence two: no constraint manipulation followed by constraint manipulation). Maximal power was recorded during exercise; then the coefficient of variation of maximal power was estimated. Post-activation responses were measured using unilateral jump height and change-of-direction time. Also, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was measured. The use of an isoinertial flywheel resulted in improved ankle dorsiflexion and the capacity to repeat change-of-direction. Furthermore, the inclusion of an opponent was associated with a higher variability of the power output in the concentric phase of the movement. Importantly, performing the crossover step task in front of an opponent was also linked to a positive correlation between unilateral countermovement jump and power output. We conclude that the inclusion of typical constraints of the performance environment may have induced movement adaptations to accommodate the unpredictability associated with the actions of the opponent.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>For randomized clinical trials where a single, primary, binary endpoint would require unfeasibly large sample sizes, composite endpoints (CEs) are widely chosen as the primary endpoint. Despite being commonly used, CEs entail challenges in designing and interpreting results. Given that the components may be of different relevance and have different effect sizes, the choice of components must be made carefully. Especially, sample size calculations for composite binary endpoints depend not only on the anticipated effect sizes and event probabilities of the composite components but also on the correlation between them. However, information on the correlation between endpoints is usually not reported in the literature which can be an obstacle for designing future sound trials. We consider two-arm randomized controlled trials with a primary composite binary endpoint and an endpoint that consists only of the clinically more important component of the CE. We propose a trial design that allows an adaptive modification of the primary endpoint based on blinded information obtained at an interim analysis. Especially, we consider a decision rule to select between a CE and its most relevant component as primary endpoint. The decision rule chooses the endpoint with the lower estimated required sample size. Additionally, the sample size is reassessed using the estimated event probabilities and correlation, and the expected effect sizes of the composite components. We investigate the statistical power and significance level under the proposed design through simulations. We show that the adaptive design is equally or more powerful than designs without adaptive modification on the primary endpoint. Besides, the targeted power is achieved even if the correlation is misspecified at the planning stage while maintaining the type 1 error. All the computations are implemented in R and illustrated by means of a peritoneal dialysis trial.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The aim of the current study is to analyze the effects of red and yellow cards on the scoring rate in elite soccer. The sample was composed of 1826 matches in the top five European leagues. All events were structured in 5-min intervals and were analyzed by means of a Generalized Linear Mixed Model with Poisson distribution, considering the presence of correlated data, where the dependent variable is represented by scoring rate. Team strength and home advantage were considered implicitly by means of a transformation of the betting odds for each game. The model also took into account the goal difference and time evolution. Overall, we found that after a sending off, each team’s scoring rate changes significantly, damaging the penalised team and favouring its opponent. When the player who is sent off belongs to the Away team, the impact of a red card is more or less maintained over time intervals. The red card effect, on the other hand, tends to fade over time when the affected team is stronger. The relative difference in scoring rates is also affected by the goal difference and the difference in booked players, being slightly lower for the team going ahead if it has more booked players. Our approach allows estimating the expected cumulative soring rate through time for various red card scenarios. Particularly if a red card is given with 30 min of remaining time, the expected impact is 0.39 goals if the guilty player is on the visiting team and 0.50 if he plays for the home team. Coaches and analysts could use this information to establish objectives for players and teams in training and matches and to be prepared for these very different scenarios of numerical superiority or inferiority.</p>},

These visualization techniques have been used so far with different purposes by various professionals in the sport industry, such as managers, coaches, scouters, technical staff, journalists, and researchers. The abuse of graphs, such as the radar plot, and their frequent misinterpretation in the world of sports and possible implications for coaching decisions has led us to create more informative and accurate visualizations. Here, we propose new, more educational visualizations we have termed violinboxplots and enhanced radar plot for their use in the sports analytics and other fields.

   abstract = {<p>This study sought to determine whether the inclusion of an opponent on an isoinertial crossover step task influenced the post-activation response and power production. Twenty adult male team-sports athletes participated in a randomized crossover trial. We used a novel design in which the performance of an isoinertial flywheel exercise was tested with or without the inclusion of sport-specific constraints (inclusion of an opponent vs. no opponent) in one of the two sequences (sequence one: constraint manipulation followed by no constraint manipulation; and sequence two: no constraint manipulation followed by constraint manipulation). Maximal power was recorded during exercise; then the coefficient of variation of maximal power was estimated. Post-activation responses were measured using unilateral jump height and change-of-direction time. Also, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was measured. The use of an isoinertial flywheel resulted in improved ankle dorsiflexion and the capacity to repeat change-of-direction. Furthermore, the inclusion of an opponent was associated with a higher variability of the power output in the concentric phase of the movement. Importantly, performing the crossover step task in front of an opponent was also linked to a positive correlation between unilateral countermovement jump and power output. We conclude that the inclusion of typical constraints of the performance environment may have induced movement adaptations to accommodate the unpredictability associated with the actions of the opponent.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Objective: To test the efficacy of the Athletics Injury Prevention Programme (AIPP) to reduce the percentage of athletes presenting at least one injury complaint leading to participation restriction (ICPR) over an athletics season. Methods: During the 2017–2018 athletics season, we included in this cluster randomised controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03307434) 840 athletes randomly assigned (randomisation unit: athletic clubs) to a control group (regular training) or to an intervention group (regular training plus the AIPP 2/week). Using a weekly online questionnaire, athletes reported the ICPR, training and competition exposures, and, for the intervention group, the compliance with the AIPP. The primary outcome was the percentage of athletes presenting at least one ICPR over the study follow-up. Results: A total of 449 and 391 athletes were included in the intervention and control groups, respectively. From them, 68 (15.1%) and 100 (25.6%) athletes, respectively, provided 100% of the requested information during the follow-up (39 weeks). A total of 6 (8.8%) performed the AIPP 2/week or more. The proportion of athletes who had at least one ICPR over the follow-up period was similar in the intervention (64.7%) and control groups (65.0%), with adjusted odds ratios: 0.81 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.85). There were no between-group differences when comparing separately the subgroups corresponding with the different compliance levels. Conclusion: This cluster randomised controlled trial reported no efficacy of the AIPP. However, the overall response proportion and the compliance with the AIPP in the intervention group were low. In individual sports especially, efforts should be first made to improve the implementation and adoption of interventions.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In this study, we aimed to analyze the magnitude and direction of inter-limb asymmetries in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), power (using iso-inertial devices), and a neuromuscular skill (change of direction). Secondarily, we aimed to determine the relationship between inter-limb asymmetry scores for each test and also between these scores and the scores for the different performance tests. Sixteen semiprofessional male soccer players (age: 25.38 ± 6.08 years; body height: 1.78 ± 0.64 m; body mass: 79.5 ± 14.9 kg) participated in this study. We calculated inter-limb asymmetries using five tests: ankle dorsiflexion ROM, change of direction (COD 180º), and iso-inertial resistance tasks in the open (leg extension strength (LE), leg curl strength (LC)) and closed (crossover step (CRO)) kinetic chain. Our results showed that asymmetry magnitudes differed between all tests with highest inter-limb asymmetries displayed during iso-inertial overloading. In addition, we observed that the direction of asymmetries varied depending on the test-specificity, and that the CRO asymmetries had a negative association with LE and CRO performance. These findings highlight the independent nature of asymmetries and that CRO could be an appropriate test to detect asymmetries related with the performance of soccer-specific actions (such as changes of direction). Practitioners are encouraged to use multiple tests to detect existing inter-limb differences according to the specific characteristics of each sport.</p>},

Sex differences in social cognition and metacognition could explain heterogeneity in psychosis. 174 (58 females) patients with first-episode psychosis completed a clinical, neuropsychological, social cognitive, and metacognitive assessment. Subsequent latent profile analysis split by sex yielded two clusters common to both sexes (a Homogeneous group, 53% and 79.3%, and an Indecisive group, 18.3% and 8.6% of males and females, respectively), a specific male profile characterized by presenting jumping to conclusions (28.7%) and a specific female profile characterized by cognitive biases (12.1%). Males and females in the homogeneous profile seem to have a more benign course of illness. Males with jumping to conclusions had more clinical symptoms and more neuropsychological deficits. Females with cognitive biases were younger and had lower self-esteem. These results suggest that males and females may benefit from specific targeted treatment and highlights the need to consider sex when planning interventions.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Population aging in most industrialized societies has led to a dramatic increase in emergency medical demand among the elderly. In the context of private health care, an optimal allocation of the medical resources for seniors is commonly done by forecasting their life spans. Accounting for each subject's particularities is therefore indispensable, so the available data must be processed at an individual level. We use a large and unique dataset of insured parties aged 65 and older to appropriately relate the emergency care usage with mortality risk. Longitudinal and time‐to‐event processes are jointly modeled, and their underlying relationship can therefore be assessed. Such an application, however, requires some special features to also be considered. First, longitudinal demand for emergency services exhibits a nonnegative integer response with an excess of zeros due to the very nature of the data. These subject‐specific responses are handled by a zero‐inflated version of the hierarchical negative binomial model. Second, event times must account for the left truncation derived from the fact that policyholders must reach the age of 65 before they may begin to be observed. Consequently, a delayed entry bias arises for those individuals entering the study after this age threshold. Third, and as the main challenge of our analysis, the association parameter between both processes is expected to be age‐dependent, with an unspecified association structure. This is well‐approximated through a flexible functional specification provided by penalized B‐splines. The parameter estimation of the joint model is derived under a Bayesian scheme.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The present study aimed to establish the kinetics of the appearance of coliphage plaques using the double agar layer titration technique to evaluate the feasibility of using traditional coliphage plaque forming unit (PFU) enumeration as a rapid quantification method. Repeated measurements of the appearance of plaques of coliphages titrated according to ISO 10705-2 at different times were analysed using non-linear mixed-effects regression to determine the most suitable model of their appearance kinetics. Although this model is adequate, to simplify its applicability two linear models were developed to predict the numbers of coliphages reliably, using the PFU counts as determined by the ISO after only 3 hours of incubation. One linear model, when the number of plaques detected was between 4 and 26 PFU after 3 hours, had a linear fit of: (1.48 × Counts3 h + 1.97); and the other, values &amp;gt;26 PFU, had a fit of (1.18 × Counts3 h + 2.95). If the number of plaques detected was &amp;lt;4 PFU after 3 hours, we recommend incubation for (18 ± 3) hours. The study indicates that the traditional coliphage plating technique has a reasonable potential to provide results in a single working day without the need to invest in additional laboratory equipment.</p>},

A new confidence interval to conduct the quality equivalence test and a way to cope with the multiplicity of quality parameters are presented and discussed. As an example, the results and the statistical analysis of a study on betamethasone 0.5 mg/g ointment are presented. It is suggested that the equivalence limits proposed in the draft guideline are overly strict: It is as difficult to declare quality equivalence between two packaging formats of the same reference product as to declare quality equivalence between the reference and the test product.</p>},

This disease has been proved to be the major cause of death in both the developed and developing countries. Lifestyle, environmental factors, and genetic factors pose as risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of risk factors among healthy individuals elucidates the probable occurrence of CAD in near future. Genome‐wide association studies have suggested the association of chromosome 9p21.3 in the premature onset of CAD. The risk factors of CAD include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, homocystinuria, and psychosocial stress. The eradication and management of CAD has been established through extensive studies and trials. Antiplatelet agents, nitrates, β‐blockers, calcium antagonists, and ranolazine are some of the few therapeutic agents used for the relief of symptomatic angina associated with CAD.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Purpose: To evaluate interobserver and intertest agreement between optical coherence tomography (OCT) and retinography in the detection of glaucoma through a telemedicine program. Methods: A stratified sample of 4113 individuals was randomly selected, and those who accepted underwent examination including visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), non-mydriatic retinography, and imaging using a portable OCT device. Participants’ data and images were uploaded and assessed by 16 ophthalmologists on a deferred basis. Two independent evaluations were performed for all participants. Agreement between methods was assessed using the kappa coefficient and the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). We analyzed potential factors possibly influencing the level of agreement. Results: The final sample comprised 1006 participants. Of all suspected glaucoma cases (n = 201), 20.4% were identified in retinographs only, 11.9% in OCT images only, 46.3% in both, and 21.4% were diagnosed based on other data. Overall interobserver agreement outcomes were moderate to good with a kappa coefficient of 0.37 and a PABAK index of 0.58. Higher values were obtained by experienced evaluators (kappa = 0.61; PABAK = 0.82). Kappa and PABAK values between OCT and photographs were 0.52 and 0.82 for the first evaluation. Conclusion: In a telemedicine screening setting, interobserver agreement on diagnosis was moderate but improved with greater evaluator expertise.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) represent rare neoplasms of all NETs often presenting without functional activity. Many sporadic non-functioning pNET patients are already metastatic at the time of diagnosis, and the therapeutic approach to such patients is mostly palliative. In this international, multicentre, retrospective cohort study, we assessed the prognostic value of a set of anthropometric, clinical, biochemical, radiological and pathological parameters at baseline and the impact of the therapeutic strategies on the survival of patients with sporadic grade 1/2, stage IV, non-functioning pNETs. Three hundred and twelve consecutive patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2010 were included. The median overall survival (OS) was 6.6 years and survival at 5 and 10 years was 62 and 34% respectively. On univariate analysis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status ≥2, grade 2, bilobar hepatic metastases, synchronous metastases, and high chromogranin A, alkaline-phosphatase and lactic-dehydrogenase were associated with a significant reduction of OS. Palliative/curative surgery and loco-regional hepatic interventions were significant factors improving OS. On multivariate analysis, ECOG status ≥2, synchronous metastases, Ki-67 ≥10%, and high alkaline-phosphatase correlated significantly with an increased risk of death. Both palliative/curative surgery and loco-regional hepatic interventions had a positive impact on OS. Although most parameters did not prove to be independent OS predictors at multivariate analysis, they showed a tendency towards that. Future prospective studies including larger patient populations may give greater clarity. We believe the integration of these parameters has the potential to provide a reliable prognostic score for the stratification of patients with sporadic well-differentiated metastatic non-functioning pNETs.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Metatranscriptome analysis or the analysis of the expression profiles of whole microbial communities has the additional challenge of dealing with a complex system with dozens of different organisms expressing genes simultaneously. An underlying issue for virtually all metatranscriptomic sequencing experiments is how to allocate the limited sequencing budget while guaranteeing that the libraries have sufficient depth to cover the breadth of expression of the community. Estimating the required sequencing depth to effectively sample the target metatranscriptome using RNA‐seq is an essential first step to obtain robust results in subsequent analysis and to avoid overexpansion, once the information contained in the library reaches saturation. Here, we present a method to calculate the sequencing effort using a simulated series of metatranscriptomic/metagenomic matrices. This method is based on an extrapolation rarefaction curve using a Weibull growth model to estimate the maximum number of observed genes as a function of sequencing depth. This approach allowed us to compute the effort at different confidence intervals and to obtain an approximate a priori effort based on an initial fraction of sequences. The analytical pipeline presented here may be successfully used for the in‐depth and time‐effective characterization of complex microbial communities, representing a useful tool for the microbiome research community.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Effect estimates from randomized trials and observational studies might not be directly comparable because of differences in study design, other than randomization, and in data analysis. We propose a 3-step procedure to facilitate meaningful comparisons of effect estimates from randomized trials and observational studies: 1) harmonization of the study protocols (eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, outcome, start and end of follow-up, causal contrast) so that the studies target the same causal effect, 2) harmonization of the data analysis to estimate the causal effect, and 3) sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of discrepancies that could not be accounted for in the harmonization process. To illustrate our approach, we compared estimates of the effect of immediate with deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy in individuals positive for the human immunodeficiency virus from the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) randomized trial and the observational HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) are a main component of the current antiretroviral regimens recommended for treatment of HIV infection. However, little is known about the impact of INSTI on neurocognition and neuroimaging. We developed a prospective observational trial to evaluate the effects of INSTI-based antiretroviral therapy on comprehensive brain outcomes (cognitive, functional, and imaging) according to the time since HIV-1 acquisition. We recruited men living with HIV who initiated antiretroviral therapy with INSTI &lt; 3 months since the estimated date of HIV-1 acquisition (n = 12) and &gt; 6 months since estimated date of HIV-1 acquisition (n = 15). We also recruited a group of matched seronegative individuals (n = 15). Assessments were performed at baseline (before initiation of therapy in HIV arms) and at weeks 4 and 48. Baseline cognitive functioning was comparable between the arms. At week 48, we did not find cognitive differences between starting therapy with INSTI earlier than 3 months or later than 6 months after acquisition of HIV-1 infection. Functional status was poorer in individuals diagnosed earlier. This effect recovered 48 weeks after initiation of therapy. Regarding brain imaging, we found that men living with HIV initiating antiretroviral therapy later experienced a greater decrease in medial orbitofrontal cortex over time, with expected negative repercussions for decision-making tasks.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)–infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function–5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load &lt;50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Bisphosphonates are the first‐line treatment for preventing fractures in osteoporosis patients. However, their use is contraindicated or to be used with caution in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, primarily because of a lack of information about their safety and effectiveness. We aimed to investigate the safety of oral bisphosphonates in patients with moderate to severe CKD, using primary‐care electronic records from two cohorts, CPRD GOLD (1997–2016) and SIDIAP (2007–2015) in the UK and Catalonia, respectively. Both databases were linked to hospital records. SIDIAP was also linked to end‐stage renal disease registry data. Patients with CKD stages 3b to 5, based on two or more estimated glomerular filtration rate measurements less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2</sup> , aged 40 years or older were identified. New bisphosphonate users were propensity score–matched with up to five non‐users to minimize confounding within this population. Our primary outcome was CKD stage worsening (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] decline or renal replacement therapy). Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding/ulcers, and severe hypocalcemia. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression and Fine and Gray sub‐HRs were calculated for competing risks. We matched 2447 bisphosphonate users with 8931 non‐users from CPRD and 1399 users with 6547 non‐users from SIDIAP. Bisphosphonate use was associated with greater risk of CKD progression in CPRD (sub‐HR [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.04, 1.26]) and SIDIAP (sub‐HR: 1.15 [1.04, 1.27]). No risk differences were found for acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding/ulcers, or hypocalcemia. Hence, we can conclude a modest (15%) increased risk of CKD progression was identified in association with bisphosphonate use. No other safety concerns were identified. Our findings should be considered before prescribing bisphosphonates to patients with moderate to severe CKD. © 2020 The Authors. <italic>Journal of Bone and Mineral Research</italic> published byWiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR). </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Direct-coupling analysis (DCA) for studying the coevolution of residues in proteins has been widely used to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its sequence. We present RADI/raDIMod, a variation of the original DCA algorithm that groups chemically equivalent residues combined with super-secondary structure motifs to model protein structures. Interestingly, the simplification produced by grouping amino acids into only two groups (polar and non-polar) is still representative of the physicochemical nature that characterizes the protein structure and it is in line with the role of hydrophobic forces in protein-folding funneling. As a result of a compressed alphabet, the number of sequences required for the multiple sequence alignment is reduced. The number of long-range contacts predicted is limited; therefore, our approach requires the use of neighboring sequence-positions. We use the prediction of secondary structure and motifs of super-secondary structures to predict local contacts. We use RADI and raDIMod, a fragment-based protein structure modelling, achieving near native conformations when the number of super-secondary motifs covers &amp;gt;30–50% of the sequence. Interestingly, although different contacts are predicted with different alphabets, they produce similar structures.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Domestication fundamentally reshaped animal morphology, physiology and behaviour, offering the opportunity to investigate the molecular processes driving evolutionary change. Here we assess sheep domestication and artificial selection by comparing genome sequence from 43 modern breeds ( <italic>Ovis aries</italic> ) and their Asian mouflon ancestor ( <italic>O. orientalis</italic> ) to identify selection sweeps. Next, we provide a comparative functional annotation of the sheep genome, validated using experimental ChIP-Seq of sheep tissue. Using these annotations, we evaluate the impact of selection and domestication on regulatory sequences and find that sweeps are significantly enriched for protein coding genes, proximal regulatory elements of genes and genome features associated with active transcription. Finally, we find individual sites displaying strong allele frequency divergence are enriched for the same regulatory features. Our data demonstrate that remodelling of gene expression is likely to have been one of the evolutionary forces that drove phenotypic diversification of this common livestock species. </p>},

   abstract = {<p> The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies allowed relative quantification of microbiome communities and their spatial and temporal variation. In recent years, supervised learning (i.e., prediction of a phenotype of interest) from taxonomic abundances has become increasingly common in the microbiome field. However, a gap exists between supervised and classical unsupervised analyses, based on computing ecological dissimilarities for visualization or clustering. Despite this, both approaches face common challenges, like the compositional nature of next-generation sequencing data or the integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions. Here we propose a kernel framework to place on a common ground the unsupervised and supervised microbiome analyses, including the retrieval of microbial signatures (taxa importances). We define two compositional kernels (Aitchison-RBF and compositional linear) and discuss how to transform non-compositional beta-dissimilarity measures into kernels. Spatial data is integrated with multiple kernel learning, while longitudinal data is evaluated by specific kernels. We illustrate our framework through a single point soil dataset, a human dataset with a spatial component, and a previously unpublished longitudinal dataset concerning pig production. The proposed framework and the case studies are freely available in the <italic>kernInt</italic> package at <ext-link>https://github.com/elies-ramon/kernInt</ext-link> . </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool to make accurate predictions from complex data such as image, text, or video. However, its ability to predict phenotypic values from molecular data is less well studied. Here, we describe the theoretical foundations of DL and provide a generic code that can be easily modified to suit specific needs. DL comprises a wide variety of algorithms which depend on numerous hyperparameters. Careful optimization of hyperparameter values is critical to avoid overfitting. Among the DL architectures currently tested in genomic prediction, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seem more promising than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). A limitation of DL is in interpreting the results. This may not be relevant for genomic prediction in plant or animal breeding but can be critical when deciding the genetic risk to a disease. Although DL technologies are not ”plug-and-play”, they are easily implemented using Keras and TensorFlow public software. To illustrate the principles described here, we implemented a Keras-based code in GitHub.</p>},

   abstract = {The hazard ratio is routinely used as a summary measure to assess the treatment effect in clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints. It is frequently assumed as constant over time although this assumption often does not hold. When the hazard ratio deviates considerably from being constant, the average of its plausible values is not a valid measure of the treatment effect, can be clinically misleading and common sample size formulas are not appropriate. In this paper, we study the hazard ratio along time of a two-component composite endpoint under the assumption that the hazard ratio for each component is constant. This work considers two measures for quantifying the non-proportionality of the hazard ratio: the difference $D$ between the maximum and minimum values of hazard ratio over time and the relative measure $R$ representing the ratio between the sample sizes for the minimum detectable and the average effects. We illustrate $D$ and $R$ by means of the ZODIAC trial where the primary endpoint was progression-free survival. We have run a simulation study deriving scenarios for different values of the hazard ratios, different event rates and different degrees of association between the components. We illustrate situations that yield non-constant hazard ratios for the composite endpoints and consider the likely impact on sample size. Results show that the distance between the two component hazard ratios plays an important role, especially when they are close to 1. Furthermore, even when the treatment effects for each component are similar, if the two-component hazards are markedly different, hazard ratio of the composite is often non-constant.},

   abstract = {<p> Intact and broad immune cell effector functions and specific individual cytokines have been linked to HIV disease outcome, but their relative contribution to HIV control remains unclear. We asked whether the proteome of secreted cytokines and signaling factors in peripheral blood can be used to discover specific pathways critical for host viral control. A custom glass-based microarray, able to measure &gt;600 plasma proteins involved in cell-to-cell communication, was used to measure plasma protein profiles in 96 HIV-infected, treatment-naive individuals with high (&gt;50,000) or low (&lt;10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml) viral loads. Univariate and regression model analysis demonstrate that plasma levels of soluble interleukin-27 (IL-27) are significantly elevated in individuals with high plasma viremia ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and are positively correlated with proviral HIV-DNA copy numbers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Rho = 0.4011; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0027). Moreover, soluble IL-27 plasma levels are negatively associated with the breadth and magnitude of the total virus-specific T-cell responses and directly with plasma levels of molecules involved in <italic>Wnt/β-catenin</italic> signaling. In addition to IL-27, gene expression levels of the specific IL-27 receptor ( <italic>IL27RA</italic> ) in PBMC correlated directly with both plasma viral load (Rho = 0.3531; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0218) and the proviral copy number in the peripheral blood as an indirect measure of partial viral reservoir (Rho = 0.4580; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0030). These results were validated in unrelated cohorts of early infected subjects as well as subjects before and after initiation of antiretroviral treatment, and they identify IL-27 and its specific receptor as a critical immune axis for the antiviral immune response and as robust correlates of viral load and proviral reservoir size in PBMC. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Pathologic complete response (pCR) is a common primary endpoint for a phase II trial or even accelerated approval of neoadjuvant cancer therapy. If granted, a two‐arm confirmatory trial is often required to demonstrate the efficacy with a time‐to‐event outcome such as overall survival. However, the design of a subsequent phase III trial based on prior information on the pCR effect is not straightforward. Aiming at designing such phase III trials with overall survival as primary endpoint using pCR information from previous trials, we consider a mixture model that incorporates both the survival and the binary endpoints. We propose to base the comparison between arms on the difference of the restricted mean survival times, and show how the effect size and sample size for overall survival rely on the probability of the binary response and the survival distribution by response status, both for each treatment arm. Moreover, we provide the sample size calculation under different scenarios and accompany them with the R package survmixer where all the computations have been implemented. We evaluate our proposal with a simulation study, and illustrate its application through a neoadjuvant breast cancer trial.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In an infectious disease cohort study, individuals who have been infected with a pathogen are often recruited for follow up. The period between infection and the onset of symptomatic disease, referred to as the incubation period, is of interest because of its importance on disease surveillance and control. However, the incubation period is often difficult to ascertain due to the uncertainty associated with asymptomatic infection onset time. An additional complication is that the observed infected subjects are likely to have longer incubation periods due to the prevalent sampling. In this article, we demonstrate how to estimate the distribution of the incubation period with the uncertain infection onset, subject to left‐truncation and right‐censoring. We employ a family of sufficiently general parametric models, the generalized odds‐rate class of regression models, for the underlying incubation period and its correlation with covariates. In simulation studies, we assess the finite sample performance of the model fitting and hazard function estimation. The proposed method is illustrated on data from the HIV/AIDS study on injection drug users admitted to a detoxification program in Badalona, Spain.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Many biomedical studies focus on the association between a longitudinal measurement and a time-to-event outcome while quantifying this association by means of a longitudinal-survival joint model. In this article we propose using the $LLR$ test — a longitudinal extension of the log-rank test statistic given by Peto and Peto (1972) — to provide evidence of a plausible association between a time-to-event outcome (right- or interval-censored) and a time-dependent covariate. As joint model methods are complex and hard to interpret, it is wise to conduct a preliminary test such as $LLR$ for checking the association between both processes. The $LLR$ statistic can be expressed in the form of a weighted difference of hazards, yielding a broad class of weighted log-rank test statistics known as $LWLR$, which allow a specific emphasis along the time axis of the effects of the time-dependent covariate on the survival. The asymptotic distribution of $LLR$ is derived by means of a permutation approach under the assumption that the censoring mechanism is independent of the survival time and the longitudinal covariate. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the test statistics $LLR$ and $LWLR$, showing that the empirical size is close to the nominal significance level and that the power of the test depends on the association between the covariates and the survival time. A data set together with a toy example are used to illustrate the $LLR$ test. The data set explores the study Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (Sparling and others, 2006) which includes interval-censored data. A software implementation of our method is available on github (https://github.com/RamonOller/LWLRtest).</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Carotenoid intake has been reported to be associated with improved cardiovascular health, but there is little information on actual plasma concentrations of these compounds as biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. The objective was to investigate the association between circulating plasma carotenoids and different cardiometabolic risk factors and the plasma fatty acid profile. This is a cross-sectional evaluation of baseline data conducted in a subcohort (106 women and 124 men) of an ongoing multi-factorial lifestyle trial for primary cardiovascular prevention. Plasma concentrations of carotenoids were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The associations between carotenoid concentrations and cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed using regression models adapted for interval-censored variables. Carotenoid concentrations were cross-sectionally inversely associated with serum triglyceride concentrations [−2.79 mg/dl (95% CI: −4.25, −1.34) and −5.15 mg/dl (95% CI: −7.38, −2.93), <italic>p</italic> -values = 0.0002 and &amp;lt;0.00001 in women and men, respectively], lower levels of plasma saturated fatty acids [−0.09% (95% CI: −0.14, −0.03) and −0.15 % (95% CI: −0.23, −0.08), <italic>p</italic> -values = 0.001 and 0.0001 in women and men, respectively], and higher levels of plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids [(0.12 % (95% CI: −0.01, 0.25) and 0.39 % (95% CI: 0.19, 0.59), <italic>p</italic> -values = 0.065 and 0.0001 in women and men, respectively] in the whole population.

   abstract = {<p>Major depression disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent psychiatric comorbid condition in cocaine use disorder (CUD). The comorbid MDD might be primary-MDD (CUD-primary-MDD) or cocaine-induced MDD (CUD-induced-MDD), and their accurate diagnoses and treatment is a challenge for improving prognoses. This study aimed to assess the tryptophan/serotonin (Trp/5-HT) system with the acute tryptophan depletion test (ATD), and the kynurenine pathway in subjects with CUD-primary-MDD, CUD-induced-MDD, MDD and healthy controls. The ATD was performed with a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled design. Markers of enzymatic activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) and kynureninase were also established. Following ATD, we observed a decrease in Trp levels in all groups. Comparison between CUD-induced-MDD and MDD revealed significant differences in 5-HT plasma concentrations (512 + 332 ng/mL vs. 107 + 127 ng/mL, p = 0.039) and the Kyn/5-HT ratio (11 + 15 vs. 112 + 136; p = 0.012), whereas there were no differences between CUD-primary-MDD and MDD. Effect size coefficients show a gradient for all targeted markers (d range 0.72–1.67). Results suggest different pathogenesis for CUD-induced-MDD, with lower participation of the tryptophan system, probably more related to other neurotransmitter pathways and accordingly suggesting the need for a different pharmacological treatment approach.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Morbid obesity and bariatric surgery induce anatomical, physiological and metabolic alterations that may alter the body’s disposition of drugs. Current literature on this topic is limited and sometimes inconsistent. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a superfamily of enzymes that metabolize around 75% of all marketed drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index and bariatric surgery on CYP activities. Firstly, we evaluated the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of 4 major CYP isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2) in normal weight, overweight, and morbidly obese individuals. Secondly, we assessed the short- (1 month) and medium-term (6 month) effects of the most commonly employed bariatric surgery techniques (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) on the activity of these enzymes. CYP3A4 activity was lower in morbidly obese individuals, compared to normal-weight controls. Interestingly, bariatric surgery normalized CYP3A4 activity. In comparison with normal-weight controls, morbidly obese individuals had higher CYP2D6 activity, which was only observed in individuals with two functional alleles for this isoenzyme. Neither body mass index nor surgery had significant effects on CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 activities. Overall, no relevant differences in CYP activities were found between surgical techniques. In conclusion, further studies should evaluate whether the observed alterations in CYP3A4 activity will require dose adjustments for CYP3A4 substrates especially in morbidly obese individuals before and after bariatric surgery. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Concerns have been raised recently by players’ associations regarding the risk of death among retired players. Using a retrospective cohort study, we analyzed factors associated with the mortality of National Basketball Association (NBA) players and compared their life expectancy with that of the general population. We analyzed a cohort of 3985 players who participated in the NBA from its inception in 1946 to April 2015 (481 active and 3504 former players). We used the data for the 3504 former NBA players, of whom 687 (19.1%) died before 15 April 2015, to study the elapsed time between the end of their NBA careers until death. Cox proportional hazards models were employed in the multivariate survival analysis. After adjusting for age at the end of the NBA career and calendar year, we found that mortality is associated with height and ethnicity. Taller players and African-American players had a higher instantaneous risk of death than shorter players or white players. In addition, the life expectancy of players (regardless of height and ethnicity) has increased since the inception of the NBA. This is one of the first studies using such an extensive cohort of professional basketball players and Cox proportional hazards models. Results confirmed that height is associated with mortality. In addition, ethnicity is also linked to mortality; white players and small players live longer. Our study is useful for devising strategies for health interventions and the proper allocation of resources with respect to the general population.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not always observed exactly due to uncertain onset times of infection and disease symptoms. In this paper, we demonstrate how to estimate the distribution of incubation and its association with patient demographic factors when the exact dates of infection and symptoms’ onset may not be observed. The findings from analysis of the confirmed COVID-19 cases indicate that age could be associated with the incubation period, and an age-specific quarantine policy might be more efficient than a unified one in confining COVID-19.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an inherited rare hepatic disorder due to mutations within the hydroxymethylbilane gene. AIP patients with active disease overproduce aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) in the liver which are exported inducing severe neurological attacks. Different hepatic metabolic abnormalities have been described to be associated with this condition. The goal of this research was to explore the metabolome of symptomatic AIP patients by state-of-the art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A case versus control study including 18 symptomatic AIP patients and 33 healthy controls was performed. Plasmatic levels of 51 metabolites and 16 ratios belonging to four metabolic pathways were determined. The results showed that the AIP patients presented significant changes in the two main areas of the metabolome under study: (a) the tryptophan/kynurenine pathway with an increase of tryptophan in plasma together with increase of the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio; and (b) changes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) including increase of succinic acid and decrease of the fumaric acid/succinic acid ratio. We performed a complementary in vitro study adding ALA to hepatocytes media that showed some of the effects on the TCA cycle were parallel to those observed in vivo. Our study confirms in plasma previous results obtained in urine showing that AIP patients present a moderate increase of the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio possibly associated with inflammation. In addition, it also reports changes in the mitochondrial TCA cycle that, despite requiring further research, could be associated with an energy misbalance due to sustained overproduction of heme-precursors in the liver.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS) is accompanied by altered neuro-architecture, deficient synaptic plasticity, and excitation-inhibition imbalance in critical brain regions for learning and memory. Recently, we have demonstrated beneficial effects of a combined treatment with green tea extract containing (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and cognitive stimulation in young adult DS individuals. Although we could reproduce the cognitive-enhancing effects in mouse models, the underlying mechanisms of these beneficial effects are unknown. Here, we explored the effects of a combined therapy with environmental enrichment (EE) and EGCG in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS at young age. Our results show that combined EE-EGCG treatment improved corticohippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Cognitive improvements were accompanied by a rescue of cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) dendritic spine density and a normalization of the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers in CA1 and dentate gyrus.</p>},

A new confidence interval to conduct the quality equivalence test and a way to cope with the multiplicity of quality parameters are presented and discussed. As an example, the results and the statistical analysis of a study on betamethasone 0.5 mg/g ointment are presented. It is suggested that the equivalence limits proposed in the draft guideline are overly strict: It is as difficult to declare quality equivalence between two packaging formats of the same reference product as to declare quality equivalence between the reference and the test product.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Measurement of external load in players provides objective information to optimise the weekly balance between training and recovery to improve performance and prevent injuries. Our aim was to evaluate the incidence of sports-related muscle injuries of the lower limb in relation to external load, measured by global positioning system (GPS), in football players. A descriptive study was carried out. Data were collected from 71 professional male football players (30 professionals and 41 youth players) from an elite football club competing in the Spanish and European League in the 2017–2018 season. As external load variables, we measured High Metabolic Load Distance (HMLD), High Speed Running (HSR), Player Load (PL), and Total Distance (TD) through GPS. Injury rate (IR) was calculated both in relation to such GPS load metrics and to load exposure time. We considered categories (youth and professional), playing positions (centre back, full back, midfielder, and forward), and training day with respect to match-day (-4MD, -3MD, -2MD, -1MD, MD, +1MD, +2MD). The GPS load metrics HMLD, HSR, PL, and TD showed very similar patterns across categories and positions, but varied according to training session or MD. The highest loads were observed on MD and three days prior to the match (-3MD). Similarly, the overall IR, both calculated per load exposure time and per GPS load metrics, was highest on MD and -3MD. Again, no differences were observed between youth and professional players. Midfielders demonstrated the highest IR in all metrics, followed by the forwards. In conclusion, this study suggests that external load and incidence of muscle injuries are directly proportional. Therefore, the measurement of more external load variables other than load exposure time, such as the GPS metrics HMLD, HSR, PL, and TD may help to describe the pattern and magnitude of injuries. Future studies based on ours may help to further improve the understanding of the incidence of muscle injuries on the basis of external loads measurements in different football teams.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Objective: To evaluate the association between prematurity (by the gestational week [gw]) and ADHD during childhood. Method: Observational, matched cohort study using data from children born in a tertiary-level hospital (Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron, Catalonia, Spain) during 1995-2007 and data from the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Health Care (SIDIAP database, Catalonia, Spain). Results: Prevalence of ADHD increases as gestational age decreases, 12.7% for those born ≤28 gw, compared to 3.2% for those born after the 37 gw. The risk of developing ADHD in the non-premature children tends to increase as the gw decreases (35-36 gw, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.19, 2.44]; 33-34 gw, HR = 3.38, 95% CI [2.08, 5.50]; 29-32 gw, HR = 2.37, 95% CI [1.54, 3.63]; and ≤28 gw, HR = 5.57, 95% CI [2.49, 12.46]) Conclusion: Being born preterm is associated with a risk of developing ADHD, also in late preterm children (35-36 gw). Attention when taking care of these infants regarding their mental health must be made.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>A role of iron as a target to prevent stroke-induced neurodegeneration has been recently revisited due to new evidence showing that ferroptosis inhibitors are protective in experimental ischemic stroke and might be therapeutic in other neurodegenerative brain pathologies. Ferroptosis is a new form of programmed cell death attributed to an overwhelming lipidic peroxidation due to excessive free iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to explore the therapeutic efficacy of the iron chelator and antioxidant deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) in ischemic stroke patients. Administration of placebo or a single DFO bolus followed by a 72 h continuous infusion of three escalating doses was initiated during the tPA infusion, and the impact on blood transferrin iron was determined. Primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoint was good clinical outcome (clinicalTrials.gov NCT00777140). DFO was found safe as adverse effects were not different between placebo and DFO arms. DFO (40–60 mg/Kg/day) reduced the iron saturation of blood transferrin. A trend to efficacy was observed in patients with moderate-severe ischemic stroke (NIHSS &gt; 7) treated with DFO 40–60 mg/Kg/day. A good outcome was observed at day 90 in 31% of placebo vs. 50–58% of the 40–60 mg/Kg/day DFO-treated patients.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Microbes inhabiting intermittent streambeds are responsible for controlling and developing many biogeochemical processes essential for the ecosystem functions. Although streambed microbiota is adapted to intermittency the intensification of water scarcity and prolonged dry periods may jeopardise their capacity to cope with hydrological changes. This study aims to evaluate whether, and to what extent, the duration of dry periods affects streambed microbial density, diversity, composition (16S rRNA gene diversity) and functions (extracellular enzyme activities and respiration). Our results highlight the fact that hydrology modulates the community composition and, to some extent, the functions carried out under different environmental conditions. The relative abundance of certain taxa inhabiting the driest intermittent communities differs significantly from those found at sites with continuous flow. Microbial functional metrics revealed a progressive increase in recalcitrant carbon degradation activity at sites with an extended dry phase. In contrast, bacterial density and diversity were mainly influenced by the catchment land use, agriculture enhanced density but reduced diversity, and the presence of riparian vegetation supported greater streambed bacterial diversity. From this perspective, a combination of prolonged dryness with reduced riparian vegetation and increased agricultural land cover could compromise the ecosystem functioning by threaten microbially mediated processes linked to the carbon cycle.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Stream microbes that occur in the Mediterranean Basin have been shown to possess heightened sensitivity to intensified water stress attributed to climate change. Here, we investigate the effects of long-term drought (150 days), storms and rewetting (7 days) on the diversity and composition of archaea, bacteria and fungi inhabiting intermittent streambed sediment (surface and hyporheic) and buried leaves. Hydrological alterations modified the archaeal community composition more than the bacterial community composition, whereas fungi were the least affected. Throughout the experiment, archaeal communities colonizing sediments showed greater phylogenetic distances compared to those of bacteria and fungi, suggesting considerable adaptation to severe hydrological disturbances. The increase in the class abundances, such as those of Thermoplasmata within archaea and of Actinobacteria and Bacilli within bacteria, revealed signs of transitioning to a drought-favoured and soil-like community composition. Strikingly, we found that in comparison to the drying phase, water return (as sporadic storms and rewetting) led to larger shifts in the surface microbial community composition and diversity. In addition, microhabitat characteristics, such as the greater capacity of the hyporheic zone to maintain/conserve moisture, tended to modulate the ability of certain microbes (e.g., bacteria) to cope with severe hydrological disturbances.</p>},

Una de las responsabilidades del artista contemporáneo es adoptar posiciones que ayuden a dar significado, a proyectar sentido sobre la acumulación visual a la que nos enfrentamos. En este artículo pasamos a describir dos exposiciones de la artista Pilar Rosado: Revolutionary Arkive y Mnemosyne 2.0. En ellas se ha utilizado la red neuronal artificial ResNet-50 para extraer las características visuales de grandes conjuntos de imágenes y los descriptores de imagen obtenidos se han usado como entrada para el algoritmo t-SNE. Así, se han elaborado grandes mapas visuales formados por miles de imágenes ordenadas siguiendo criterios de similitud formal en los que se ponen de manifiesto los patrones visuales de los arquetipos de una determinada categoría semántica. La manera de archivar y recuperar nuestra memoria colectiva debe tener una correlación con los avances tecnológicos y científicos de nuestra época para que se nos vayan descubriendo progresivamente nuevos horizontes de conocimiento. En su práctica artística, Rosado explora, en el ámbito de la cocreación humano-máquina, cuestiones políticas que se pueden abordar desde la imagen y que implican a las tecnologías de aprendizaje automático, como la gestión de la información en los archivos visuales del futuro o la revisión de la memoria visual colectiva.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Post-mortem tissues samples are a key resource for investigating patterns of gene expression. However, the processes triggered by death and the post-mortem interval (PMI) can significantly alter physiologically normal RNA levels. We investigate the impact of PMI on gene expression using data from multiple tissues of post-mortem donors obtained from the GTEx project. We find that many genes change expression over relatively short PMIs in a tissue-specific manner, but this potentially confounding effect in a biological analysis can be minimized by taking into account appropriate covariates. By comparing ante- and post-mortem blood samples, we identify the cascade of transcriptional events triggered by death of the organism. These events do not appear to simply reflect stochastic variation resulting from mRNA degradation, but active and ongoing regulation of transcription. Finally, we develop a model to predict the time since death from the analysis of the transcriptome of a few readily accessible tissues.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental step in eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis. Here, we develop an efficient and reproducible pipeline for the discovery of genetic variants that affect AS (splicing QTLs, sQTLs). We use it to analyze the GTEx dataset, generating a comprehensive catalog of sQTLs in the human genome. Downstream analysis of this catalog provides insight into the mechanisms underlying splicing regulation. We report that a core set of sQTLs is shared across multiple tissues. sQTLs often target the global splicing pattern of genes, rather than individual splicing events. Many also affect the expression of the same or other genes, uncovering regulatory loci that act through different mechanisms. sQTLs tend to be located in post-transcriptionally spliced introns, which would function as hotspots for splicing regulation. While many variants affect splicing patterns by altering the sequence of splice sites, many more modify the binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Genetic variants affecting splicing can have a stronger phenotypic impact than those affecting gene expression.</p>},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.</p>},

GANs have enabled us to achieve an unprecedented degree of realism in the creation of synthetic images of human faces, landscapes, and buildings, among others. Not only image generation, but also image manipulation is possible with GANs. Generative deep learning models are inherently limited in their creative abilities because of a focus on learning for perfection. We investigated the potential of GAN’s latent spaces to encode human expressions, highlighting creative interest for suboptimal solutions rather than perfect reproductions, in pursuit of the artistic concept. We have trained Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and StyleGAN using a collection of portraits of detained persons, portraits of dead people who died of violent causes, and people whose portraits were taken during an orgasm. We present results which diverge from standard usage of GANs with the specific intention of producing portraits that may assist us in the representation and recognition of otherness in contemporary identity construction.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a vast unexplored genetic space that may hold missing drivers of tumourigenesis, but few such “driver lncRNAs” are known. Until now, they have been discovered through changes in expression, leading to problems in distinguishing between causative roles and passenger effects. We here present a different approach for driver lncRNA discovery using mutational patterns in tumour DNA. Our pipeline, ExInAtor, identifies genes with excess load of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across panels of tumour genomes. Heterogeneity in mutational signatures between cancer types and individuals is accounted for using a simple local trinucleotide background model, which yields high precision and low computational demands. We use ExInAtor to predict drivers from the GENCODE annotation across 1112 entire genomes from 23 cancer types. Using a stratified approach, we identify 15 high-confidence candidates: 9 novel and 6 known cancer-related genes, including <italic>MALAT1, NEAT1</italic> and <italic>SAMMSON</italic> . Both known and novel driver lncRNAs are distinguished by elevated gene length, evolutionary conservation and expression. We have presented a first catalogue of mutated lncRNA genes driving cancer, which will grow and improve with the application of ExInAtor to future tumour genome projects. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>We have produced RNA sequencing data for 53 primary cells from different locations in the human body. The clustering of these primary cells reveals that most cells in the human body share a few broad transcriptional programs, which define five major cell types: epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, neural, and blood cells. These act as basic components of many tissues and organs. Based on gene expression, these cell types redefine the basic histological types by which tissues have been traditionally classified. We identified genes whose expression is specific to these cell types, and from these genes, we estimated the contribution of the major cell types to the composition of human tissues. We found this cellular composition to be a characteristic signature of tissues and to reflect tissue morphological heterogeneity and histology. We identified changes in cellular composition in different tissues associated with age and sex, and found that departures from the normal cellular composition correlate with histological phenotypes associated with disease.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The use of mouse models has revolutionized the field of Down syndrome (DS), increasing our knowledge about neuropathology and helping to propose new therapies for cognitive impairment. However, concerns about the reproducibility of results in mice and their translatability to humans have become a major issue, and controlling for moderators of behavior is essential. Social and environmental factors, the experience of the researcher, and the sex and strain of the animals can all have effects on behavior, and their impact on DS mouse models has not been explored. Here we analyzed the influence of a number of social and environmental factors, usually not taken into consideration, on the behavior of male and female wild-type and trisomic mice (the Ts65Dn model) in one of the most used tests for proving drug effects on memory, the novel object recognition (NOR) test. Using principal component analysis and correlation matrices, we show that the ratio of trisomic mice in the cage, the experience of the experimenter, and the timing of the test have a differential impact on male and female and on wild-type and trisomic behavior. We conclude that although the NOR test is quite robust and less susceptible to environmental influences than expected, to obtain useful results, the phenotype expression must be contrasted against the influences of social and environmental factors.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> <bold>Background</bold> : Precision medicine is the Holy Grail of interventions that are tailored to a patient’s individual characteristics. However, conventional clinical trials are designed to find differences in averages, and interpreting these differences depends on untestable assumptions. Although only an ideal, a constant effect of treatment would facilitate individual management. A direct consequence of a constant effect is that the variance of the outcome measure would be the same in the treated and control arms. We reviewed the literature to explore the similarity of these variances as a foundation for examining whether and how often precision medicine is definitively required. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Bioequivalence studies are the pivotal clinical trials submitted to regulatory agencies to support the marketing applications of generic drug products. Average bioequivalence (ABE) is used to determine whether the mean values for the pharmacokinetic measures determined after administration of the test and reference products are comparable. Two‐stage 2×2 crossover adaptive designs (TSDs) are becoming increasingly popular because they allow making assumptions on the clinically meaningful treatment effect and a reliable guess for the unknown within‐subject variability. At an interim look, if ABE is not declared with an initial sample size, they allow to increase it depending on the estimated variability and to enroll additional subjects at a second stage, or to stop for futility in case of poor likelihood of bioequivalence. This is crucial because both parameters must clearly be prespecified in protocols, and the strategy agreed with regulatory agencies in advance with emphasis on controlling the overall type I error.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Background: Data with ordinal categories occur in many diverse areas, but methodologies for modeling ordinal data lag severely behind equivalent methodologies for continuous data. There are advantages to using a model specifically developed for ordinal data, such as making fewer assumptions and having greater power for inference. Methods: The ordered stereotype model (OSM) is an ordinal regression model that is more flexible than the popular proportional odds ordinal model. The primary benefit of the OSM is that it uses numeric encoding of the ordinal response categories without assuming the categories are equally-spaced. Results: This article summarizes two recent advances in the OSM: (1) three novel tests to assess goodness-of-fit; (2) a new Generalized Estimating Equations approach to estimate the model for longitudinal studies. These methods use the new spacing of the ordinal categories indicated by the estimated score parameters of the OSM. Conclusions: The recent advances presented can be applied to several fields. We illustrate their use with the well-known arthritis clinical trial dataset. These advances fill a gap in methodologies available for ordinal responses and may be useful for practitioners in many applied fields.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>(1) Cognitive decline differs among individuals and cognition function domains. We sought to identify distinct groups of immediate and delayed verbal memory in two age subsamples (50–64, 65+ years), and to analyze associated factors. (2) Latent class mixed models were used to identify verbal memory trajectories in a sample of Spanish community-dwelling individuals over 8 years’ follow up. Chi-square and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to assess differences among trajectories. (3) Different trajectories were identified. In the case of immediate verbal memory, these were: very low/decline (6.3%), low/stable (38.2%), medium/slow decline (43.4%), and high/slow decline (12.2%) in the middle-aged group, and low/decline (20.4%), medium/slow decline (60.4%), and high/slow decline (19.2%) in the older subsample. In delayed verbal memory, more distinct patterns were found: very low/decline (12.4%), low/stable (51.4%), medium/accelerated decline (24.7%), and high/slow increase (11.4%) in the younger group, and low/slow decline (34.4%), medium/decline (52.7%), and high/slow decline (12.9%) in the older group. (4) Overall, low initial performance and decline were associated with older age, lower education, and higher diabetes/stroke prevalence. Differences found suggests heterogeneity in cognitive ageing. The high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in those with worse cognition suggests that early interventions to prevent those conditions should be targeted in midlife to delay cognitive decline.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The accessibility and availability of a variety of online gambling for adolescents is a public concern. In the current literature, it remains unclear in which activities the greatest prevalence occurs. Moreover, it is well-known that different types of gambling activities carry different levels of risk just as have distinct socioeconomic, and mental health-related consequences. The main aim of this study is to systematically review the current literature in order to explore the prevalence of different types of online gambling activities reported by adolescents and their relationship with other reported variables when available. It will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-P 2015 statement for systematic review and metaanalysis protocols. An electronic literature search will be conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using search keywords and logic as follows: “(Internet OR online) gambling AND (adolescents OR young people)”. Additionally, further articles will be identified through searching the citations in the literature selected. The overall percentage of online gamblers and the percentage of online gamblers for each type of gambling activity were identified or calculated. Seven-teen articles met the eligibility criteria. The included studies comprised 15 crosssectional and two longitudinal designs. Most of the research was conducted in Europe. The online gambling modalities detected were sports bets, card games, gambling machines, casino games lottery games, scratch tickets, bingo, gambling in social networking, stock market investment, and mahjong. Only two studies provided associations between a specific online gambling activity and socioeconomic and mental health associations, founding involvement in online sports betting and in online casino game is a risk factor to the development of disordered gambling. A consensus on the evaluation method of the problem and updated questionnaires collecting information regarding the new online betting modalities are critical.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Subjects with first-episode psychosis experience substantial deficits in social cognition and metacognition. Although previous studies have investigated the role of profiles of individuals in social cognition and metacognition in chronic schizophrenia, profiling subjects with first-episode psychosis in both domains remains to be investigated. We used latent profile analysis to derive profiles of the abilities in 174 persons with first-episode psychosis using the Beck’s Cognitive Insight Scale, the Faces Test, the Hinting Task, the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire, and the Beads Task. Participants received a clinical assessment and a neuropsychological assessment. The best-fitting model was selected according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We assessed the importance of the variables via a classification tree (CART). We derived three clusters with distinct profiles. The first profile (33.3%) comprised individuals with low social cognition. The second profile (60.9%) comprised individuals that had more proneness to present jumping to conclusions. The third profile (5.7%) presented a heterogeneous profile of metacognitive deficits. Persons with lower social cognition presented worse clinical and neuropsychological features than cluster 2 and cluster 3. Cluster 3 presented significantly worst functioning. Our results suggest that individuals with FEP present distinct profiles that concur with specific clinical, neuropsychological, and functional challenges. Each subgroup may benefit from different interventions.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>This paper presents two new model-based goodness-of-fit tests for the ordered stereotype model applied to an ordinal response variable. The proposed tests are based on the Lipsitz test, which partitions the subjects into G groups following the popular Hosmer–Lemeshow test for binary data. The tests construct an alternative model where group effects are added into the null model. If the model fits the data well then the null model is correct, and there should be no group effects. One of the main advantages of the ordered stereotype model is that it allows us to determine a new uneven spacing of the ordinal response categories, dictated by the data. The two proposed tests use this new adjusted spacing. One test uses the form of the original ordered stereotype model, and the other uses an ordinary linear model. We demonstrate the performance of both tests under a variety of scenarios. Finally, the results of the application in three examples are presented.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In recent years, the evidence regarding Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) suggests that some personality traits are important risk factors for developing this problem. The heterogeneity involved in problematic online gaming and differences found in the literature regarding the comorbid psychopathology associated with the problem could be explained through different types of gamers. Clustering analysis can allow organization of a collection of personality traits into clusters based on similarity. The objectives of this study were: (1) to obtain an empirical classification of IGD patients according to personality variables and (2) to describe the resultant groups in terms of clinical and sociodemographic variables. The sample included 66 IGD adolescent patients who were consecutive referrals at a mental health center in Barcelona, Spain. A Gaussian mixture model cluster analysis was used in order to classify the subjects based on their personality. Two clusters based on personality traits were detected: type I “higher comorbid symptoms” (n = 24), and type II “lower comorbid symptoms” (n = 42). The type I included higher scores in introversive, inhibited, doleful, unruly, forceful, oppositional, self-demeaning and borderline tendency traits, and lower scores in histrionic, egotistic and conforming traits. The type I obtained higher scores on all the Symptom Check List-90 items-Revised, all the State-Trait Anxiety Index scales, and on the DSM-5 IGD criteria. Differences in personality can be useful in determining clusters with different types of dysfunctionality.</p>},

The publicly available data set associated with the HDI can be seen as a table with 3 dimensions (three-way table): countries, indexes regarding progress, and years (from 2010 to 2018). Thus, modeling the serial dependence structure of this type of intricate three-way tables is a challenge. D-vine copulas are a special class of multivariate copulas that are particularly suited for modeling serial dependence. This work aims to assess the evolution of the dependence relationship between the indexes of the HDI data set over time through D-vine copulas, which has not been fully used before in the area, as far as we are concerned. We tested our approach to European and African countries and compare their results.</p>},

This study presents a method based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), in combination with machine learning methods, for the correct identification and quantification of adulterants in juices. Thus, three types of 100% squeezed juices (pineapple, orange, and apple) were evaluated and adulterated with grape juice at different percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%). The results of the exploratory data analysis revealed a clear clustering trend of the samples according to the type of juice analyzed. The supervised learning analysis, based on the development of models for the detection of adulteration, obtained significant results for all tested methods (i.e., support-vector machines or SVM), random forest or RF, and linear discriminant analysis or LDA) with an accuracy above 97% on the test set. Regarding quantification, the best results are obtained with the support vector regression and with partial least square regression showing an R2 greater than 0.99 and a root mean square error (RMSE) less than 1.4 for the test set.</p>},

We developed a diagnostic algorithm for deciding whether to use VBN to reach PPLs or choose an alternative diagnostic approach. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We compared diagnostic yield between VBN-UTB (prospective cases) and unguided UTB (historical controls) and analyzed the VBN-UTB subgroup to identify clinical and technical variables that could predict the success of VBN-UTB. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Fifty-five cases and 110 controls were included. The overall diagnostic yield did not differ between the VBN-guided and unguided arms (47 and 40%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.354). Although the yield was slightly higher for PPLs ≤20 mm in the VBN-UTB arm, the difference was not significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.069). No other clinical characteristics were associated with a higher yield in a subgroup analysis, but an 85% diagnostic yield was observed when segmentation was optimal and the PPL was endobronchial (vs. 30% when segmentation was suboptimal and 20% when segmentation was optimal but the PPL was extrabronchial). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; VBN-guided UTB is not superior to unguided UTB. A greater impact of VBN-guided over unguided UTB is highly dependent on both segmentation quality and an endobronchial location of the PPL. Segmentation quality should be considered before starting a procedure, when an alternative technique that may improve yield can be chosen, saving time and resources.</p>},

Here, we use patient-level data from the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) to summarise COVID-19 outcomes in Catalonia, Spain. We included 5,586,521 individuals from the general population. Of these, 102,002 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 16,901 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5273 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19 between 1st March and 6th May 2020. Older age, being male, and having comorbidities were all generally associated with worse outcomes. These findings demonstrate the continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly older people, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death were lower for younger populations, there is a need to limit their role in community transmission.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic started in December 2019 and still is a major global health challenge. Lockdown measures and social distancing sparked a global shift towards online learning, which deeply impacted universities’ daily life, and the University of Barcelona (UB) was not an exception. Accordingly, we aimed to determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at the UB. To that end, we performed a cross-sectional study on a sample of 2784 UB members (n = 52,529). Participants answered a brief, ad hoc, online epidemiological questionnaire and provided a nasal swab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 analysis and a venous blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay. Total prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR or positive IgG) was 14.9% (95%CI 13.3 to 17.0%). Forty-four participants (1.6%, 95%CI: 1.2–2.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 12.8% (95%CI: 11.6–14.1%) of participants. Overall, while waiting for population vaccination and/or increased herd immunity, we should concentrate on identifying and isolating new cases and their contacts.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rationale:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) guidance to peripheral pulmonary lesions is often limited by insufficient segmentation of the peripheral airways. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; To test the effect of applying positive airway pressure (PAP) during CT acquisition to improve segmentation, particularly at end-expiration. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; CT acquisitions in inspiration and expiration with 4 PAP protocols were recorded prospectively and compared to baseline inspiratory acquisitions in 20 patients. The 4 protocols explored differences between devices (flow vs. turbine), exposures (within seconds vs. 15-min) and pressure levels (10 vs. 14 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Segmentation quality was evaluated with the number of airways and number of endpoints reached. A generalized mixed-effects model explored the estimated effect of each protocol. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Patient characteristics and lung function did not significantly differ between protocols. Compared to baseline inspiratory acquisitions, expiratory acquisitions after 15 min of 14 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O PAP segmented 1.63-fold more airways (95% CI 1.07–2.48; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.018) and reached 1.34-fold more endpoints (95% CI 1.08–1.66; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). Inspiratory acquisitions performed immediately under 10 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O PAP reached 1.20-fold (95% CI 1.09–1.33; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.001) more endpoints; after 15 min the increase was 1.14-fold (95% CI 1.05–1.24; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.001). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; CT acquisitions with PAP segment more airways and reach more endpoints than baseline inspiratory acquisitions. The improvement is particularly evident at end-expiration after 15 min of 14 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O PAP. Further studies must confirm that the improvement increases diagnostic yield when using VBN to evaluate peripheral pulmonary lesions.</p>},

Although this syndrome has a considerable impact on the patient's quality of life, its medical treatment is far from optimal. Material &amp; methods: We performed an observational study to evaluate Nucleo CMP Forte <sup>TM</sup>  in patients with electromyography-confirmed, mild–moderate CTS. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale, electromyogram and the SF-36. Results: Pain decreased significantly after 6 months. Quality of life improved significantly in the pain dimensions. No significant differences were observed in electromyographic findings. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Nucleotides could prove useful for the nonsurgical treatment of CTS. Further studies are necessary to confirm this. </p>},

@article{Hueso2020,
   abstract = {<p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The 2019 Science for Dialysis Meeting at Bellvitge University Hospital was devoted to the challenges and opportunities posed by the use of data science to facilitate precision and personalized medicine in nephrology, and to describe new approaches and technologies. The meeting included separate sections for issues in data collection and data analysis. As part of data collection, we presented the institutional ARGOS e-health project, which provides a common model for the standardization of clinical practice. We also pay specific attention to the way in which randomized controlled trials offer data that may be critical to decision-making in the real world. The opportunities of open source software (OSS) for data science in clinical practice were also discussed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Summary:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Precision medicine aims to provide the right treatment for the right patients at the right time and is deeply connected to data science. Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology to live, and their treatment generates a huge volume of data that has to be analysed. Data science has emerged as a tool to provide an integrated approach to data collection, storage, cleaning, processing, analysis, and interpretation from potentially large volumes of information. This is meant to be a perspective article about data science based on the experience of the experts invited to the Science for Dialysis Meeting and provides an up-to-date perspective of the potential of data science in kidney disease and dialysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Healthcare is quickly becoming data-dependent, and data science is a discipline that holds the promise of contributing to the development of personalized medicine, although nephrology still lags behind in this process. The key idea is to ensure that data will guide medical decisions based on individual patient characteristics rather than on averages over a whole population usually based on randomized controlled trials that excluded kidney disease patients. Furthermore, there is increasing interest in obtaining data about the effectiveness of available treatments in current patient care based on pragmatic clinical trials. The use of data science in this context is becoming increasingly feasible in part thanks to the swift developments in OSS.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> An interesting evolutionary question that still remains open is the connectivity between marine populations. Marine currents can favour the dispersal of larvae or adults, but they can also produce eddies and gyres generating oceanographic fronts, thus limiting gene flow. To address this subject, we selected the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, where several fronts are located: Gibraltar Strait (GS), Almeria-Oran Front (AOF) and Ibiza Channel (IC). Seven populations of the marine crab <italic>Liocarcinus depurator</italic> (Cadiz, West and East Alboran, Alacant, Valencia, Ebro Delta and North Catalonia) located along this transition were analysed in six consecutive years (2014–2019) using a fragment of the <italic>COI</italic> ( <italic>Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I</italic> ) gene. All sequences (966) belonged to two well defined haplogroups: ATL (most abundant in Atlantic waters) and MED (predominant in Mediterranean waters). Following a geographic variation, the frequency of ATL decreased significantly from Cadiz to North Catalonia. However, this variation presented steps due to the effect of oceanographic restrictions/fronts. Significant effects were recorded for GS (2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019), AOF (all years except 2018) and IC (2016). The intensity and precise location of these fronts changed over time. Multivariate analyses distinguished three main population groups: Cadiz, Alboran Sea and the remaining Mediterranean populations. These findings could be relevant to properly define Marine Protected Areas and for conservation and fisheries policies. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Cocaine is one of the most used psychostimulant drugs worldwide. MicroRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that are highly expressed in brain, and several studies have shown that cocaine can alter their expression. In a previous study, we identified several protein-coding genes that are differentially expressed in a dopaminergic neuron-like model after an acute exposure to cocaine. Now, we used the prediction tool WebGestalt to identify miRNA molecules potentially involved in the regulation of these genes. Using the same cellular model, we found that seven of these miRNAs are down-regulated by cocaine: miR-124-3p, miR-124-5p, miR-137, miR-101-3p, miR-9-5p, miR-369-3p and miR-153-3p, the last three not previously related to cocaine. Furthermore, we found that three of the miRNA genes that are differentially expressed in our model (hsa-miR-9-1, hsa-miR-153-1 and hsa-miR-124-3) are nominally associated with cocaine dependence in a case–control study (2,085 cases and 4,293 controls). In summary, we highlighted novel miRNAs that may be involved in those cocaine-induced changes of gene expression that underlie addiction. Moreover, we identified genetic variants that contribute to cocaine dependence in three of these miRNA genes, supporting the idea that genes differentially expressed under cocaine may play an important role in the susceptibility to cocaine dependence.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Transparency laws facilitate citizens to monitor the activities of political representatives. In this sense, automatic or manual diarization of parliamentary sessions is required, the latter being time consuming. In the present work, this problem is addressed as a person re-identification problem. Re-identification is defined as the process of matching individuals under different camera views. This paper, in particular, deals with open world person re-identification scenarios, where the captured probe in one camera is not always present in the gallery collected in another one, i.e., determining whether the probe belongs to a novel identity or not. This procedure is mandatory before matching the identity. In most cases, novelty detection is tackled applying a threshold founded in a linear separation of the identities. We propose a threshold-less approach to solve the novelty detection problem, which is based on a one-class classifier and therefore it does not need any user defined threshold. Unlike other approaches that combine audio-visual features, an Isometric LogRatio transformation of a posteriori (ILRA) probabilities is applied to local and deep computed descriptors extracted from the face, which exhibits symmetry and can be exploited in the re-identification process unlike audio streams. These features are used to train the one-class classifier to detect the novelty of the individual. The proposal is evaluated in real parliamentary session recordings that exhibit challenging variations in terms of pose and location of the interveners. The experimental evaluation explores different configuration sets where our system achieves significant improvement on the given scenario, obtaining an average F measure of 71.29% for online analyzed videos. In addition, ILRA performs better than face descriptors used in recent face-based closed world recognition approaches, achieving an average improvement of 1.6% with respect to a deep descriptor.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Global warming is an environmental phenomenon to which species must adapt to survive. <italic>Drosophila subobscura</italic> presents an adaptive capacity due to its chromosomal inversion polymorphism. Until now, the impact of global warming on this polymorphism has been studied in <italic>D. subobscura</italic> populations located either on a continental mainland or on islands not far from a continent. In this context, gene flow could be a relevant mechanism allowing the movement of thermally adapted inversions between populations. Our aim was to sample and study the chromosomal polymorphism on Madeira, a small isolated island in the Atlantic Ocean. We compared our findings with those reported in the same location approximately four and five decades ago. Moreover, we studied whether global warming has occurred on this island by analyzing mean, maximum and minimum temperatures over a 55‐year period. All atmospheric parameters have increased significantly, consistent with climate change expectations. Frequencies and chromosomal thermal index values of thermal adapted inversions remained quite stable over years. Furthermore, J, U and O chromosomes are almost fixed for “warm” adapted inversions. Thus, if there is little genetic variability remaining and temperatures continue increasing, island populations of <italic>D. subobscura</italic> might be on the threshold of endangerment. However, apart from selection, genetic drift and inbreeding, other processes, such as phenotypic plasticity or thermoregulatory behavior, could be involved in the survival of the species’ populations. Finally, although in danger, <italic>D. subobscura</italic> is a generalist that lives in humanized environments, and this fact could favor its persistence on Madeira Island. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Drosophila has demonstrated to be an excellent model to study the adaptation of organisms to global warming, with inversion chromosomal polymorphism having a key role in this adaptation. Here, we introduce a new index (Chromosomal Thermal Index or CTI) to quantify the thermal adaptation of a population according to its composition of “warm” and “cold” adapted inversions. This index is intuitive, has good statistical properties, and can be used to hypothesis on the effect of global warming on natural populations. We show the usefulness of CTI using data from European populations of D. subobscura, sampled in different years. Out of 15 comparisons over time, nine showed significant increase of CTI, in accordance with global warming expectations. Although large regions of the genome outside inversions contain thermal adaptation genes, our results show that the total amount of warm or cold inversions in populations seems to be directly involved in thermal adaptation, whereas the interactions between the inversions content of homologous and non-homologous chromosomes are not relevant.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Genetic factors involved in the susceptibility to drug addiction still remain largely unknown. MiRNAs seem to play key roles in the drug-induced plasticity of the brain that likely drives the emergence of addiction. In this work we explored the role of miRNAs in drug addiction. With this aim, we selected 62 SNPs located in the 3’UTR of target genes that are predicted to alter the binding of miRNA molecules and performed a case-control association study in a Spanish sample of 735 cases (mainly cocaine-dependent subjects with multiple drug dependencies) and 739 controls. We found an association between rs1047383 in the <italic>PLCB1</italic> gene and drug dependence that was replicated in an independent sample (663 cases and 667 controls). Then we selected 9 miRNAs predicted to bind the rs1047383 region, but none of them showed any effect on <italic>PLCB1</italic> expression. We also assessed two miRNAs binding a region that contains a SNP in linkage disequilibrium with rs1047383, but although one of them, hsa-miR-582, was found to downregulate <italic>PLCB1</italic> , no differences were observed between alleles. Finally, we explored the possibility that <italic>PLCB1</italic> expression is altered by cocaine and we observed a significant upregulation of the gene in the nucleus accumbens of cocaine abusers and in human dopaminergic-like neurons after cocaine treatment. Our results, together with previous studies, suggest that <italic>PLCB1</italic> participates in the susceptibility to drug dependence. </p>},

The delay of the seed extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse with respect to the amplifier gas jet was scanned by changing the distance between the gas jets. Experiments and numerical calculations show that parametric amplification occurs within a temporal window of several optical cycles. Strong correlation between the seed and amplifier was observed in a shorter, few optical cycles delay range, which appeared as a modulation of the XUV intensity with an unexpected one optical cycle periodicity instead of half optical cycle. Simulations revealed that the strong correlation and also the unusual periodicity was the consequence of the nonlinear effect produced by plasma dispersion on the parametric amplification process during propagation in the amplifier jet.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The aim of the paper is to explain the basic principles of carrying out an inventory and follow-up of buildings and their condition assessment, by using the Full Interactive Visualization Method for Building Condition Assessment platform. It is a platform enabling the implementation of construction inventory based on the remote cooperation of many specialists in the field of, among others: building construction, architecture, civil engineering, photogrammetry, CAD, UAV. This type of cooperation is of particular importance especially in the context of the current epidemiological situation related to COVID-19. The idea of the presented platform fits into the broadly understanding of Building Information Modeling. After introducing the methodology, stages of the inventory and follow-up process carried out within the platform are illustrated and discussed on the basis of a case study. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that the proposed methodology creates a convenient, efficient and inexpensive tool for massive inspection of building resources in large areas. The inventory is based primarily on high-quality photo and video material obtained from the deck of an unmanned aerial vehicle and the expert knowledge of the inspector conducting the inspection. By combining digital images data (photos, 3D model, orthophotos) with substantive data (facade element classification tables, wear / defect classification tables), we get a platform that allows intuitive access to viewing, classification, editing and analysis of selected data.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Resumen Está firmemente demostrada la importancia de realizar mantenimiento preventivo en los edificios, para evitar que se degraden y aparezcan lesiones graves. También está demostrado que con el mantenimiento preventivo se ahorra dinero frente al mantenimiento correctivo. En el marco del mantenimiento cabe decir que, para realizar las inspecciones periódicas de los edificios, es de gran utilidad el poder cuantificar hasta qué punto las deficiencias existentes son graves o no, con objeto de facilitar la toma de decisiones y priorizar las intervenciones terapéuticas. De hecho, se han utilizado y utilizan numerosas escalas diferentes entre sí para valorar el grado de gravedad de los elementos constructivos. Pero no existe consenso común y estas escalas son diferentes entre sí según el estudio a que pertenezcan. Por ejemplo, en las diferentes normas ITE existentes en España se utilizan diferentes escalas y formas de valorar las deficiencias existentes y no hay consenso común en el método de valoración. El objetivo del presente artículo es proponer, en base a un largo y riguroso proceso metodológico, una escala que sirva para valorar el grado de gravedad de los daños en edificios, que pueda ser utilizada de manera generalizada. Abstract The importance of performing preventive maintenance on buildings is clearly demonstrated, in order to prevent them from deterioration and severe damages. It is also demonstrated that preventive maintenance saves money versus corrective maintenance. In the framework of maintenance, to make periodic inspections of the buildings is useful to quantify the extent to which deteriorations are severe or not, in order to facilitate decision making and prioritize interventions. To this purpose many scales have been used and are used to assess the severity of damage and deterioration of the building components. But it appears evident that there is not common consensus and these scales are different between them, according to the study they belong to. Everything referred shows the need to propose and validate a scale that serves to assess the degree of severity of construction elements in buildings, which is widely used. Therefore, the objective of this article is to propose, based on a long and rigorous methodological process, a scale that serves to assess the degree of severity of damage in buildings, which can be widely used.</p>},

These vehicles might utilize ultra-reliable telecommunication systems, Internet-based technologies, and navigation satellite services to locate their customers and other team vehicles to plan their routes. Furthermore, the team of vehicles should serve their customers by specified due date efficiently. Coordination between the vehicles might be needed to be accomplished in real-time in exceptional cases, such as after a traffic accident or extreme weather conditions. This paper presents the planning of vehicle routes as a team orienteering problem. In addition, an ‘agile’ optimization algorithm is presented to plan these routes for drones and other autonomous vehicles.

Education is one of the fields greatly affected by it, as students and teachers were forced to move online and quickly adapt to the online environment. Assessment is a crucial part of education, especially in STEM fields. A gap analysis was performed by expert groups in the frame of an Erasmus+ project looking at the practices of six European countries. Specialists teaching university-grade mathematics in seven European institutions were asked about their perception of gaps in the assessment of students both before (2019) and during (2021) the pandemic. This qualitative study looks at the difference in perception of such gaps after almost one year of online teaching. The analysis of their responses showed that some gaps were present before the pandemic, as well as others that are specific to it. Some gaps, such as the lack of IT infrastructure and the need to adapt materials to an online environment, have been exacerbated by the outbreak.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is a well-established technique for remote acquisition of geometrical data of a tested object. For the past two decades it has been commonly used in geodesy, surveying and related areas for acquiring data about spacing of civil engineering structures and buildings. An average TLS apparatus, apart from 3D coordinates registers radiometric information of laser beam reflectance. This radiometric information of the laser beam reflectance is usually called intensity and has no meaning for solely geometric measurements. Nevertheless, the value of intensity depends mainly on physicochemical properties of scanned material such as roughness, colour and saturation. Keeping these facts in mind, authors suggest using changes in value of intensity to locate various imperfections on a brick wall. So far, authors have conducted a thorough and successful research programme dedicated to detection of saturation and saturation movement in brick walls. Based on this experience a new research programme was conducted focused on various aspects of detection of brick wall defects. The main aim of the paper is to present the possibility of using the intensity value in for the diagnostics of the technical condition of a brick walls. Advantages and limitations of harnessing TLS for detection of surface defects of brick walls are presented and discussed in the paper.</p>},

In this study, we aim to explore the relationships between the different acting e-RA variables and to check for predictive models in order to infer on the savings amount in construction public procurement. Data on real construction auctions in Slovakia were statistically analysed by means of graphics tools, multiple regression analysis, test, and statistics for measuring the association between categorical variables. The results revealed that one should take the type of contract into account when considering the use of e-RA. This research provides several implications for purchasing practitioners in the area of construction procurement, especially with regard to the level of competition in the auction and estimation of savings potential. Presented findings aid managerial decision-making process of e-RA adoption. At the end, recommended future research directions in the investigated area are outlined.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The aim of the paper is to introduce a tool for the accurate assessment of the technical condition of buildings. The proposed methodology is becoming an efficient strategy for the massive inspection of building stocks, in big residential areas. The authors have developed an utility based on high-performance images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The flights of the UAVs have been technically protocolized in order to get the proper high-quality information about the real condition of the building. After collecting the images a 3D model is generated and orthophotos of building facades are created. The graphical information is connected with tables of attributes which allow the interactive geo-referenced management and assessment. Main requirements and advantages of this visualization technique will be presented by analyzing a particular case study. The selected example will allow the illustration of the methodology. Ongoing developments and technical details about the information system and the analysis platform connected with the visualization tool will be also reported.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Association between spatial gait parameters and adverse health outcomes in the elderly has not been sufficiently studied. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether the stride length or the step width predict falls, functional loss and mortality. We conducted a prospective cohort study on a probabilistic sample of 431 noninstitutionalized, older-than-64-years subjects living in Spain, who were followed-up for five years. In the baseline visit, spatial gait parameters were recorded along with several control variables, with special emphasis on known medical conditions, strength, balance and functional and cognitive capacities. In the follow-up calls, vital status, functional status and number of falls from last control were recorded. We found that a normalized-to-height stride length shorter than 0.52 predicted recurrent falls in the next 6 months with 93% sensitivity and 53% specificity (AUC: 0.72), and in the next 12 months with 81% sensitivity and 57% specificity (AUC: 0.67). A normalized stride length &lt;0.5 predicted functional loss at 12 months with a sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 65.6% (AUC: 0.75). This predictive capacity remained independent after correcting for the rest of risk factors studied. Step-with was not clearly related to functional loss or falls. Both shorter normalized stride length (OR1.56; AUC: 0.62; p &lt; 0.05) and larger step width (OR1.42; AUC: 0.62; p &lt; 0.05) were associated with risk of death at 60 months; however, none of them remained as independent predictor of death, after correcting for other risk factors. In summary, spatial gait parameters may be risk markers for adverse outcomes in the elderly. Step length is independently associated with functional loss and falls at one year, after correction for numerous known risk factors.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Gait studies in the elderly population have been always conducted in gait labs or spacious clinical facilities, which influence gait parameters, and also implies that the participants have to be able to move to these facilities. Indoors gait characteristics of the elderly population have been very little studied. In this study, we aim to define the normal limits of the spatial gait parameters of the elderly, when walking at home, and to analyze relationship existing between the spatial gait parameters to other health variables. For such purpose, we conducted a transversal study on a probabilistic sample of 431 Spanish community-dwelling older, in which the spatial gait parameters were recorded by using an ink footprints method. We found that the mean stride length indoors was 88.47 cm (SD:26.05 cm; mean CI95%:85.52–91.41 cm), and the mean step width was 10.34 cm (SD:4.37 cm; mean CI95%:9.84–10.83 cm). Stride length was shorter in women and the oldest group, and was significantly influenced by the strength, balance, and physical activity. Stride width was larger in the oldest group and mainly affected by balance. A composite parameter including width and normalized stride length was independent from sex, and strongly differentiated between age groups. This parameter was affected by strength.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The oldest-old population (80 years or older) has the highest lethality from COVID-19. There is little information on the clinical presentation and specific prognostic factors for this group. This trial evaluated the clinical presentation and prognostic factors of severe disease and mortality in the oldest-old population. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This is an ambispective cohort study of oldest-old patients hospitalized for respiratory infection associated with COVID-19 and with a positive test by RT-PCR. The clinical presentation and the factors associated with severe disease and mortality were evaluated (logistic regression). All patients were followed up until discharge or death. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A total of 103 patients (59.2% female) were included. The most frequent symptoms were fever (68.9%), dyspnoea (60.2%), and cough (39.8%), and 11.7% presented confusion. Fifty-nine patients (57.3%) presented severe disease, and 59 died, with 43 patients (41.7%) presenting both of these. In the multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.13–0.73, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; 0.0074) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.21–5.37, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; 0.0139) were associated with severe disease, and serum sodium was associated with mortality (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.18–8.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; 0.0222). No chronic disease or pharmacological treatment was associated with worse outcomes. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The typical presenting symptoms of respiratory infection in COVID-19 are less frequent in the oldest-old population. Male sex and LDH level are associated with severe disease, and the serum sodium level is associated with mortality in this population.</p>},

We reviewed and analyzed 1642 records from consecutive patients at the Catheter Laboratory of Talca Regional Hospital in Chile between March 2018 and May 2019. Patients were stratified according to the presence and severity of atherosclerotic lesions: 632 (38.5%) had no lesions or &lt;30% stenosis and 1010 (61.5%) had at least one coronary atherosclerotic lesion with ≥30% stenosis (CALS-30). CALS-30 was more frequent in males, smokers, and patients with diabetes and/or hypertension (all p-values &lt; 0.02). Serum potassium, glycaemia, creatinine and glomerular filtration rates were also associated with CALS-30 (all p-values &lt; 0.01) in males. The age and the proportion of males with CALS-30 increased with the number of risk factors (p-values for trends &lt; 0.001). Our results showed a stronger association between the accumulation of risk factors and CALS-30 in women than in men. Serum potassium levels were inversely associated with CALS-30 in men but not in women.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>There is a great need for non-invasive tools that inform of an early molecular response to cancer therapeutic treatment. Here, we tested the hypothesis that proteolytically resistant proteins could be candidate circulating tumor biomarkers for cancer therapy. Proteins resistant to proteolysis are drastically under-sampled by current proteomic workflows. These proteins could be reliable sensors for the response to therapy since they are likely to stay longer in circulation. We selected manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), a mitochondrial redox enzyme, from a screening of proteolytic resistant proteins in breast cancer (BC). First, we confirmed the robustness of SOD2 and determined that its proteolytic resistance is mediated by its quaternary protein structure. We also proved that the release of SOD2 upon chemotherapy treatment correlates with cell death in BC cells. Then, after confirming that SOD2 is very stable in human serum, we sought to measure its circulating levels in a cohort of BC patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. The results showed that circulating levels of SOD2 increased when patients responded to the treatment according to the tumor shrinkage during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the measurement of SOD2 levels in plasma could improve the non-invasive monitoring of the therapeutic treatment in breast cancer patients. The identification of circulating biomarkers linked to the tumor cell death induced by treatment could be useful for monitoring the action of the large number of cancer drugs currently used in clinics. We envision that our approach could help uncover candidate tumor biomarkers to measure a tumor’s response to cancer therapy in real time by sampling the tumor throughout the course of treatment.</p>},

Severity and capacity to regenerate after AKI are important determinants of CKD progression, and of patient morbidity and mortality in the hospital setting. To determine sex differences during injury and recovery we have generated a female and male renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) pig model, which represents a major cause of AKI. Although no differences were found in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels between both sexes, females exhibited higher mononuclear infiltrates at basal and recovery, while males showed more tubular damage at injury. Global transcriptomic analyses of kidney biopsies from our IRI pig model revealed a sexual dimorphism in the temporal regulation of genes and pathways relevant for kidney injury and repair, which was also detected in human samples. Enrichment analysis of gene sets revealed five temporal and four sexual patterns governing renal IRI and recovery. Overall, this study constitutes an extensive characterization of the time and sex differences occurring during renal IRI and recovery at gene expression level and offers a template of translational value for further study of sexual dimorphism in kidney diseases.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Metabolomics and proteomics, like other omics domains, usually face a data mining challenge in providing an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Because of this, combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools aimed at simplifying metabolomics and proteomics data analysis have emerged. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to data sets with limited flexibility. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user-friendly workflow for the visualization, exploration and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other types of omics, and it is based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analyses outside the web environment.

   abstract = {<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis is a poorly understood disease entity with no specific prognostic biomarkers and scarce therapeutic options. We aimed to identify disease activity biomarkers in multiple sclerosis by performing an RNA sequencing approach in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a discovery cohort of 44 untreated patients with multiple sclerosis belonging to different clinical forms and activity phases of the disease, and 12 healthy control subjects. A validation cohort of 58 patients with multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy control subjects was included in the study to replicate the RNA sequencing findings. The RNA sequencing revealed an interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) signature in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Subsequent immunophenotyping pointed to blood monocytes as responsible for the IL1B signature observed in this group of patients. Functional experiments at baseline measuring apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation showed that the NOD-leucine rich repeat and pyrin containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was overactive in monocytes from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a combination of ATP plus lipopolysaccharide was associated with increased IL1B production in this group of patients. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis patients with high IL1B gene expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells progressed significantly faster compared to patients with low IL1B levels based on the time to reach an EDSS of 6.0 and the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score. In agreement with peripheral blood findings, both NLRP3 and IL1B expression in brain tissue from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis was mainly restricted to cells of myeloid lineage. Treatment of mice with a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor attenuated established experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease severity and improved CNS histopathology. NLRP3 inflammasome-specific inhibition was also effective in reducing axonal damage in a model of lipopolysaccharide-neuroinflammation using organotypic cerebellar cultures. Altogether, these results point to a role of IL1B and the NLRP3 inflammasome as prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target, respectively, in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Nutrition research can be conducted by using two complementary approaches: (i) traditional self-reporting methods or (ii) via metabolomics techniques to analyze food intake biomarkers in biofluids. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data. The ontology presented is called FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) and it is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a ’Food Ontology’ consisting of raw foods and ‘multi-component foods’ while the second is a ‘Biomarker Ontology’ containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties. This allows data and information regarding foods and food biomarkers to be visualized in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. Potential applications of this ontology include the annotation of foods and biomarkers using a well-defined and consistent nomenclature, the standardized reporting of metabolomics workflows (e.g. metabolite identification, experimental design) or the application of different enrichment analysis approaches to analyze nutrimetabolomic data. Availability: FOBI is freely available in both OWL (Web Ontology Language) and OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) formats at the project’s Github repository (https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology) and FOBI visualization tool is available in https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Tolerogenic dendritic cell (tolDC)-based therapies have become a promising approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases by their potential ability to restore immune tolerance in an antigen-specific manner. However, the broad variety of protocols used to generate tolDC <italic>in vitro</italic> and their functional and phenotypical heterogeneity are evidencing the need to find robust biomarkers as a key point towards their translation into the clinic, as well as better understanding the mechanisms involved in the induction of immune tolerance. With that aim, in this study we have compared the transcriptomic profile of tolDC induced with either vitamin D3 (vitD3-tolDC), dexamethasone (dexa-tolDC) or rapamycin (rapa-tolDC) through a microarray analysis in 5 healthy donors. The results evidenced that common differentially expressed genes could not be found for the three different tolDC protocols. However, individually, <italic>CYP24A1</italic> , <italic>MUCL1</italic> and <italic>MAP7</italic> for vitD3-tolDC; <italic>CD163</italic> , <italic>CCL18</italic> , <italic>C1QB</italic> and <italic>C1QC</italic> for dexa-tolDC; and <italic>CNGA1</italic> and <italic>CYP7B1</italic> for rapa-tolDC, constituted good candidate biomarkers for each respective cellular product. In addition, a further gene set enrichment analysis of the data revealed that dexa-tolDC and vitD3-tolDC share several immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory pathways, while rapa-tolDC seem to be playing a totally different role towards tolerance induction through a strong immunosuppression of their cellular processes. </p>},

   abstract = {<p> Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is known to play a role as prognostic biomarker in the early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), and patients with high cerebrospinal fluid CHI3L1 levels have an increased risk for the development of neurological disability. Here, we investigated its potential neurotoxic effect by adding recombinant CHI3L1 <italic>in vitro</italic> to primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons and evaluating both neuronal functionality and survival by immunofluorescence. CHI3L1 induced a significant neurite length retraction after 24 and 48 hours of exposure and significantly reduced neuronal survival at 48 hours. The cytotoxic effect of CHI3L1 was neuron-specific and was not observed in mouse immune or other central nervous system cells. These results point to a selective neurotoxic effect of CHI3L1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and suggest a potential role of CHI3L1 as therapeutic target in MS patients. </p>},

   abstract = {The transmembrane glycoprotein CD26 or dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a multifunctional protein. In immune system, CD26 plays a role in T-cell function and is also involved in thymic maturation and emigration patterns. In preclinical studies, treatment with DPPIV inhibitors reduces insulitis and delays or even reverses the new -onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, the specific mechanisms involved in these effects remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate how DPPIV inhibition modifies the expression of genes in the thymus of NOD mice by microarray analysis. Changes in the gene expression of β-cell autoantigens and Aire in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) were also evaluated by using qRT-PCR. A DPPIV inhibitor, MK626, was orally administered in the diet for 4 and 6 weeks starting at 6-8 weeks of age. Thymic glands from treated and control mice were obtained for each study checkpoint. Thymus transcriptome analysis revealed that 58 genes were significantly over-expressed in MK626-treated mice after 6 weeks of treatment. Changes in gene expression in the thymus were confined mainly to the immune system, including innate immunity, chemotaxis, antigen presentation and immunoregulation. Most of the genes are implicated in central tolerance mechanisms through several pathways. No differences were observed in the expression of Aire and β-cell autoantigens in TECs. In the current study, we demonstrate that treatment with the DPPIV inhibitor MK626 in NOD mice alters the expression of the immune response-related genes in the thymus, especially those related to immunological central tolerance, and may contribute to the prevention of T1D.},
